LDR notes:

in really high brightness (held up to lamp) ~0.15K ohm,
in darkness (eyglass case) maxes out meter at above 2000K ohm,
so we can just use that as a limit for the low brightness

find resistor divider value

sqrt((2000000 x 150)) = sqrt(300000000) = 17320.50808..

so ~17.32K ohms would be perfect I guess

after some testing a 33K ohm resistor worked well on my test circuit
in indoor daytime conditions

on my desk it goes to ADC value 790-850 in full light
and to 200-150-60-0 covered by my hand and 0 when fully covered by something
(my eyeglasses case)

as for nighttime idk yet
